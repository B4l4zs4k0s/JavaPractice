//Create a Sharpie class
//We should know the followings about each sharpie:
//color (which should be a string),
//width (which will be a number) and the
//inkAmount (another number)
//We need to specify the color and the width at creation
//Every sharpie is created with a default inkAmount value: 100
//We can use() the sharpie objects: using it decreases inkAmount by 10

//Sharpie Set
  Reuse your Sharpie class
  Create SharpieSet class
  it contains a list of Sharpie, named listOfSharpies
  it has a method that adds a new Sharpie to the set: add(sharpie)
  it has a method that returns the number of usable Sharpies: countUsable() -> sharpie is usable if it contains ink
  it has a method that removes all unusable Sharpies: removeTrash()
