## Pirates

Create a `Pirate` class. You can add other fields and methods, yet, you must
have these methods:

- `drinkSomeRum()` - intoxicates the Pirate by one
- `howsItGoingMate()` - when called, the Pirate replies:
  - if `drinkSomeRun()` was called less than 4 times:
    - "Pour me anudder!"
  - else:
    - "Arghh, I'ma Pirate. How d'ya d'ink its goin?". Then the pirate passes out
    and sleeps it off (gets rid of the intoxication).

If you manage to get this far, then you can try to do the following.

- `brawl(Pirate)` - where pirate fights another pirate
  (if both of them are alive):
  - there is 1/3 chance that this dies, the other dies or they both pass out.
- `die()` - this kills off the pirate. When a pirate is dead, every method
  simply results in: `he's dead`.

And... if you get that far...

Add a parrot.

## The Pirate Ship

*The place for the Pirates*

- Create a `Ship` class.
- The `Ship` stores `Pirate`instances in a list as the crew and has one
  captain who is also a `Pirate`.
- When a ship is created it doesn't have a crew or a captain.
- The ship can be filled with pirates and a captain via `fillShip()` method:
  - fills the ship with a captain and a random (maximum 113) number of pirates
- Ships should be represented in a nice way on command line including
  information about
  - rum consumed by the captain and its state (dead or alive)
  - number of alive pirates in the crew
- Ships should have a method to battle other ships: `ship.battle(otherShip)`
  - should return `true` if the actual ship (`this`) wins
  - the ship having higher calculated score wins
  - calculated score: Number of alive pirates in the crew - Number of consumed
    rum by the captain
  - The loser crew has a random number of losses (deaths).
  - The winning captain and crew has a party: everyone drinks a
    random number of rum :)
