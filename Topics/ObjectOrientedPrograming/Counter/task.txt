Create Counter class
which has a counter (integer) field
at creation it should have a default value 0
there are two ways to create the class:
with 0 input parameters
with 1 input parameter called counter which is set as the initial value of the counter field
we can add another whole number to this counter: add(number)
we can just increase the counter's value by one: add() (no parameters)
we can get() the current counter value
and we can reset() the counter to the initial value set during the construction of the class
